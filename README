We will be solving Node Classification problem using GAT layers and multi-head attention.
Dataset: https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/torch_geometric/datasets/amazon.html

Graph Structure: The dataset is represented as a graph, where nodes correspond to products,
and edges indicate co-purchasing relationships between products. If two products are frequently
purchased together, there is an edge connecting them in the graph.


Node Features: Each node (product) has associated features. These features could include
information about the product itself, such as its category, price, or other relevant attributes.

Outcome: We managed to pass the Pitfalls of Graph Neural Network Evaluation scientific paper in terms of correctly predicting more nodes using GAT layers.
Accuracy: 89.75
